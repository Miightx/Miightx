## About me 🙂
  Hello, my name is Laurent LIN, I am a french student at Sorbonne University in Engineering for Health specialized in Mechatronic System for Rehabilitation! I am currently learning many languages such as Python, Matlab, ROS, C++ and Bash, as well as algorithms and mechanical engineering. I yearn to make a significant impact on people with my code in the future!
## My hobbies 😀
 💻 - Coding is like assuming the role of detective, analyzing riddles to crack the mystery 
 
 🧗 - A beginner in climbing, trying to beat blue blocks
 
 ✈️ - Travel to encounter new people while discovering customs and food
