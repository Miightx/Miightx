## About me 🙂
  Hello, my name is Laurent LIN, I am a french student at [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) in [Engineering for Health](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/formation-sciences/offre-de-formation/masters/master-electronique-energie-electrique-automatique-1) specialized in Mechatronic System for Rehabilitation! I am currently learning many languages such as Python, Matlab, ROS, C++ and Bash, as well as algorithms and mechanical engineering. I yearn to make a significant impact on people with my code in the future!
## My hobbies 😀
 💻 - Coding is like assuming the role of detective, analyzing riddles to crack the mystery 
 
 🧗 - A beginner in climbing, trying to beat blue blocks
 
 ✈️ - Travel to encounter new people while discovering customs and food

## Projects 🎯
### Virtual Cane 
[![Watch the video](https://github.com/Miightx/Miightx/assets/117952621/9b5f5562-5f27-4536-94db-40ac95d8bcfb)](https://youtu.be/v2bWXBLFIaI)

The virtual cane is a device created to help visually impaired people to navigate through obstacles by using vibrations. Bases on the vibrations, the user would etablish his/her surrounding and avoid obstacles. 
I was the one who designed the electrical circuit, ensured the integration of components, and corrected any issue. You can check the project [here](https://github.com/Miightx/virtual-cane).
