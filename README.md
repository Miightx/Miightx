## About me üôÇ
  Hello, my name is Laurent LIN, I am a french student at [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) in [Engineering for Health](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/formation-sciences/offre-de-formation/masters/master-electronique-energie-electrique-automatique-1) specialized in Mechatronic Systems for Rehabilitation! I am currently learning many languages such as Python, Matlab, ROS, C++ and Bash, as well as algorithms and mechanical engineering. I yearn to make a significant impact on people with my code in the future!
## My hobbies üòÄ
 üíª - Coding is like assuming the role of detective, analyzing riddles to crack the mystery 
 
 üßó - A beginner in climbing, trying to beat blue blocks
 
 ‚úàÔ∏è - Travel to encounter new people while discovering customs and food

## Projects üéØ
### Virtual Cane 
[![Watch the video](https://github.com/Miightx/Miightx/assets/117952621/9b5f5562-5f27-4536-94db-40ac95d8bcfb)](https://youtu.be/v2bWXBLFIaI)

The virtual cane is a device created to help visually impaired people to navigate through obstacles by using vibrations. Bases on the vibrations, the user would etablish his/her surrounding and avoid obstacles. 

I was the one who designed the electrical circuit, ensured the integration of components, and corrected any issue. You can check the project [here](https://github.com/Miightx/virtual-cane).

### ROS navigation
![Navigation modelization ](https://github.com/Miightx/turtlebot_burger-navigation/assets/117952621/d6ba08c4-175b-4637-b4cd-12ea9a7457d1)

A model of a Turtlebot Burger is created in ROS, where the robot is tasked with navigating through an environment. Several methods, such as OpenCV with the camera and sensor data were applied to follow a colour line and avoid obstacles. You can download the ZIP file [here](https://github.com/Miightx/turtlebot_burger-navigation). to try in your system!

### Data analysis
During my internship at the hospital, I watched many orthopedic surgeries which provide me a medical perspective on medical devices. I also manipulated data provided by EOS application to study the parameters that are related to the pelvic translation. Because the data are confidential, I haven't anonymized the sheets yet, so I am unable to show the code, sorry ... But you can read the report [here](https://github.com/Miightx/Data-analysis-pelvic-translation-/blob/main/Rapport_Stage_compressed.pdf)!

### Saboteur
![saboteur](https://github.com/Miightx/Miightx/assets/117952621/8f4878c8-3952-4648-9815-a262f47d8a4e)

Implementation of 'The Saboteur' in Python. The Saboteur is a board game in which players need to work together in order to build a path to the gold mines. However, among the players, there are saboteurs aiming to misguide the others.

I made the menu and the npc. You can find the game code  [here](https://github.com/Miightx/Saboteur/tree/main).

### Robot arm optimization
![Bras_robot](https://github.com/Miightx/robot_arm_optimization/assets/117952621/259e57e8-25c9-48c5-821b-70f70ac234d2)

Various methods such as adaptive step gradient and Newton's method were used to determine the solutions to minimize the trajectory of a robot arm. You can check the method [here](https://github.com/Miightx/robot_arm_optimization).

## Other tasks üõ†Ô∏è
### --Python--

### Reinforcement Learning
Based on the habits, an individual performs a trajectory. In order to modelize the trajectory, a control system should be apply. Therefore, a trajectory subject can be solve using LQR to adapte the control. Additionally, an environment is created using the LQR fucntion, which is used to compare with the PPO model. You can click [here](https://github.com/Miightx/RL-solving-LQR-with-PPO). to look at the subject.

### Colorization of a gray image

Using similar colored images, we attend to colour a gray image with feature extraction and implementation of the pixel color to the gray image. The program can be run [here](https://github.com/Miightx/Gray_images_to-colored).

### Bio Vision
There are several works that I implemented during my master, using various methods with OpenCV and Skimage to detect anomalies. You can check the programs [here](https://github.com/Miightx/Vision-bio).


### --MATLAB--

### LDA Classification
LDA classification is applied to several signals consisting of a set of movements performed under different conditions. A training and testing is doing to analyze the accuracy of the classification. Training and testing are conducted to analyze the accuracy of the classification. You can review the work [here](https://github.com/Miightx/Classification-of-experimentally-acquired-EMG-signals).

### --C++--
Basic C++ works are uploaded [here](https://github.com/Miightx/Cpp-practices), giving me a first approach of the computer language. More than exciting to work on the language!

### --R--
### Biostatistics
Analyzing blood sugar data and its influence on other parameters. Application of frequential and bayesian statistics and comparaison of the results with the one conducted using JASP. You can access the work [here](https://github.com/Miightx/Basic-statistics-in-R).
