## About me 🙂
  Hello, my name is Laurent LIN, I am a french student at [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) in [Engineering for Health](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/formation-sciences/offre-de-formation/masters/master-electronique-energie-electrique-automatique-1) specialized in Mechatronic Systems for Rehabilitation! I am currently learning many languages such as Python, Matlab, ROS, C++ and Bash, as well as algorithms and mechanical engineering. I yearn to make a significant impact on people with my code in the future!
## My hobbies 😀
 💻 - Coding is like assuming the role of detective, analyzing riddles to crack the mystery 
 
 🧗 - A beginner in climbing, trying to beat blue blocks
 
 ✈️ - Travel to encounter new people while discovering customs and food

## Projects 🎯
### Virtual Cane 
[![Watch the video](https://github.com/Miightx/Miightx/assets/117952621/9b5f5562-5f27-4536-94db-40ac95d8bcfb)](https://youtu.be/v2bWXBLFIaI)

The virtual cane is a device created to help visually impaired people to navigate through obstacles by using vibrations. Bases on the vibrations, the user would etablish his/her surrounding and avoid obstacles. 

I was the one who designed the electrical circuit, ensured the integration of components, and corrected any issue. You can check the project [here](https://github.com/Miightx/virtual-cane).

### ROS navigation
![Navigation modelization ](https://github.com/Miightx/turtlebot_burger-navigation/assets/117952621/d6ba08c4-175b-4637-b4cd-12ea9a7457d1)

A model of a Turtlebot Burger is created in ROS, where the robot is tasked with navigating through an environment. Several methods, such as OpenCV with the camera and sensor data were applied to follow a colour line and avoid obstacles. You can download the ZIP file [here](https://github.com/Miightx/turtlebot_burger-navigation). to try in your system!
### Saboteur

Implementation of 'The Saboteur' in Python. The Saboteur is a board game in which players need to work together in order to build a path to the gold mines. However, among the players, there are saboteurs aiming to misguide the others.

I made the menu and the npc. You can find the game code  [here](https://github.com/Miightx/Saboteur/tree/main).

### Robot arm optimization

Various methods such as adaptive step gradient and Newton's method were used to determine the solutions to minimize the trajectory of a robot arm. You can check the method [here](https://github.com/Miightx/robot_arm_optimization).

## Other tasks 🛠️
### --Python--
### Colorization of a gray image

Using similar colored images, we attend to colour a gray image with feature extraction and implementation of the pixel color to the gray image. The program can be run [here](https://github.com/Miightx/Gray_images_to-colored).

### Bio Vision
There are several works that I implemented during my master, using various methods with OpenCV and Skimage to detect anomalies. You can check the programs [here](https://github.com/Miightx/Vision-bio).
